# Real-Time Audio Translator

My wife does not know english, this app listens to your microphone or system audio, translates spoken English to Spanish (or another language), and plays back the translation as audio — plus shows subtitles.

## Installation

Download the `Danilator.exe` from the releases folder.  
Ensure your Windows sound settings have “Stereo Mix” enabled if you want to capture system audio like Zoom or Discord.

## Usage

1. Launch the app.  
2. Select your audio input device from the dropdown (microphone or Stereo Mix).  
3. Press Play to start live translation.  
4. Use Pause to temporarily stop listening.  
5. Subtitles of original and translated speech show below the buttons.

## Troubleshooting

- If you get permission errors on audio files, run the app in a folder where you have full read/write access.  
- No audio devices listed? Make sure your mic is plugged in and Stereo Mix is enabled.

## Building from source

Requires Python 3.13+ and these packages: `speech_recognition`, `deep_translator`, `gtts`, `pygame`, `pyaudio`, `Pillow`.

Run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python Danilator.py
